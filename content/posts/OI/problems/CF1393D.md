# CF1393D-Rarity and New Dress

## 题目:

### 题目描述:

Carousel Boutique is busy again! Rarity has decided to visit the pony ball and she surely needs a new dress, because going out in the same dress several times is a sign of bad manners. First of all, she needs a dress pattern, which she is going to cut out from the rectangular piece of the multicolored fabric.

The piece of the multicolored fabric consists of $ n \times m $ separate square scraps. Since Rarity likes dresses in style, a dress pattern must only include scraps sharing the same color. A dress pattern must be the square, and since Rarity is fond of rhombuses, the sides of a pattern must form a $ 45^{\circ} $ angle with sides of a piece of fabric (that way it will be resembling the traditional picture of a rhombus).

Examples of proper dress patterns: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1393D/1313c2f6e2e4ec2b50b9f433196c0f6817a45d78.png) Examples of improper dress patterns: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1393D/53b6557287b6852020c7bea84c9bc4969c632d30.png) The first one consists of multi-colored scraps, the second one goes beyond the bounds of the piece of fabric, the third one is not a square with sides forming a $ 45^{\circ} $ angle with sides of the piece of fabric.

Rarity wonders how many ways to cut out a dress pattern that satisfies all the conditions that do exist. Please help her and satisfy her curiosity so she can continue working on her new masterpiece!

### 输入格式:

The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1       \le n, m \le 2000 $ ). Each of the next $ n $ lines contains $ m $ characters: lowercase English letters, the $ j $ -th of which corresponds to scrap in the current line and in the $ j $ -th column. Scraps having the same letter share the same color, scraps having different letters have different colors.

### 输出格式:

Print a single integer: the number of ways to cut out a dress pattern to satisfy all of Rarity's conditions.

## 思路:

## 实现:

```cpp
#include "ybwhead/ios.h"
int n, m;
const int maxn = 2e3 + 10;
string s[maxn];
long long ans;
int nxt[maxn][maxn], nxt1[maxn][maxn], uu[maxn][maxn], dd[maxn][maxn];
int main()
{
    yin >> n >> m;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    {
        yin >> s[i];
        nxt[i][1] = 1;
        for (int j = 2; j <= m; j++)
        {
            if (s[i][j - 2] == s[i][j - 1])
                nxt[i][j] = nxt[i][j - 1] + 1;
            else
                nxt[i][j] = 1;
        }
        nxt1[i][m] = 1;
        for (int j = m; j >= 2; j--)
        {
            if (s[i][j - 1] == s[i][j - 2])
                nxt1[i][j - 1] = nxt1[i][j] + 1;
            else
                nxt1[i][j - 1] = 1;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
        {
            int u, d, l, r;
            if (s[i][j - 1] == s[i - 1][j - 1])
                u = uu[i - 1][j] + 1;
            else
                u = 1;
            l = nxt[i][j];
            r = nxt1[i][j];
            uu[i][j] = min(min(l, r), u);
        }
    }
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--)
    {
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
        {
            int u, d, l, r;
            if (s[i][j - 1] == s[i + 1][j - 1])
                u = dd[i + 1][j] + 1;
            else
                u = 1;
            l = nxt[i][j];
            r = nxt1[i][j];
            dd[i][j] = min(min(l, r), u);
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
        {
            ans += min(uu[i][j], dd[i][j]);
        }
    }
    yout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
