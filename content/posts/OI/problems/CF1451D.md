# CF1451D-Circle Game
## 题目:
### 题目描述:
Utkarsh is forced to play yet another one of Ashish's games. The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Ashish moves first.

Consider the 2D plane. There is a token which is initially at  $ (0,0) $ . In one move a player must increase either the $ x $ coordinate or the $ y $ coordinate of the token by exactly $ k $ . In doing so, the player must ensure that the token stays within a (Euclidean) distance $ d $ from $ (0,0) $ .

In other words, if after a move the coordinates of the token are $ (p,q) $ , then $ p^2 + q^2 \leq d^2 $ must hold.

The game ends when a player is unable to make a move. It can be shown that the game will end in a finite number of moves. If both players play optimally, determine who will win.
### 输入格式:
The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 100 $ ) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers $ d $ ( $ 1 \leq d \leq 10^5 $ ) and $ k $ ( $ 1 \leq k \leq d $ ).
### 输出格式:
For each test case, if Ashish wins the game, print "Ashish", otherwise print "Utkarsh" (without the quotes).
### 样例:
#### 样例输入1:
```
5
2 1
5 2
10 3
25 4
15441 33
```
#### 样例输出1:
```
Utkarsh
Ashish
Utkarsh
Utkarsh
Ashish
```
## 思路:

## 实现:
```cpp
#include "ybwhead/ios.h"
int main()
{
	int TTT;
	yin>>TTT;
	while(TTT--)
	{
		long long d,k;
		yin>>d>>k;
		long long x=0,y=0;
		while(1)
		{
			if(x<=y&&(x+k)*(x+k)+y*y<=d*d)
				x+=k;
			else if(x>y&&x*x+(y+k)*(y+k)<=d*d)
				y+=k;
				else break;
		}
		if(x==y)
		{
			puts("Utkarsh");
		}
		else
		{
			puts("Ashish");
		}
	}
	return 0;
}

```
